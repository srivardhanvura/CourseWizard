# First and last names

This gist has two files in it: first-names.txt and last-names.txt, each with 4096 names taken from some unnamed database.

Useful for generating mock data for testing or for opfuscating production data for testing.

See https://stackoverflow.com/a/50242368/15109 for some thoughts about data obfuscation.
